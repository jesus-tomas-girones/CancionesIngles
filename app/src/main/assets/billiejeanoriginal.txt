She was more like a beauty queen 
From a movie scene
I said don't mind but...
What do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned 
With eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me 
Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking 
Young girls' hearts
And mother always told me 
Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 
Because the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean's not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand 
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Because we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby we'd danced till three
Then she looked at me
Then she showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go on, dance on the floor in the round, babe
People always told me 
Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking 
Young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
I just smell her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean's not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean's not my lover...
